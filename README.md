# Batch-processing-multimodality-tumour-imaging
This code is designed to help simplify the batch processing (co-registration, 2D and 3D (semi-automatic) segmentation, and quantification) of longitudinally collected 2D and 3D multi-modality imaging data using Matlab. The code was originally intended for processing of tumour response kinetics following irradiation pre-clinically in a window chamber model, data acquired using optical imaging modalities (brightfield, epifluorescence, and optical coherence tomography angiography).

1) 2D lateral mask creation and 2D co-registration of OCT to brightfield/fluorescence images; 
2) Quantification of brightfield and fluorescence images for automatic extraction of tumour viability and approximate volume;
3) 3D co-registration of OCT scans inter-timepoints ;
4) 3D tumour mask creation.
